# Generate a random integer from a to b.
# You and your friend have to guess a number between two numbers, a and b.
# a and b are inputs taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and plays first.
# He will have to keep choosing the number, and your program must tell
# whether the number is greater than the actual number or less than the actual number.
# Log the number of trials it took your friend to arrive at the number.
# You play the same game, and then the person with the minimum number of trials wins!
# Randomly generate a number after taking a and b as input and donâ€™t show that to the user.
#
# Input:
# Enter the value of a
# 4
# Enter the value of b
# 13
#
# Output:
# Player1:
#
# Please guess the number between 4 and 13
#
# 5
#
# Wrong guess a greater number again
# 8
# Wrong guess a smaller number again
# 6
# Correct, you took 3 trials to guess the number
# Player 2:
# Correct, you took 7 trials to guess the number
#
#    Player 1 wins!
