#F strings stand for fast string
# to use it we use f before giving the string in ""

p = 'pepsi'
z = 'coca-cola'
print('Is', z, 'better or, is', p, 'better?')   #this is really an inefficient way and not clear to read

print(f'Is {z} better or is {p} better?')   # Due to the f  string we can understand where are variables are printing more clearly
